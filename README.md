### Hi, It's Michael's Git ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student, interested in deep learning and computer vision.
I'm very curious about new technologies, 
I love coming up with new solutions and ideas for problems,
and I am looking to make a real impact at any place I am in.

During my Bachelor's degree, I have developed a bot in order to help students at the Technion. You can see the repository **TBOT**. You are also welcome to try and [use the bot](https://t.me/Technion_help_bot).

Currently, I work at a government company in the field of computer vision and deep learning.
