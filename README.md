I'm a computer science student at the Technion.
I'm interested in deep learning and computer vision.
I'm very curious about new technologies, 
and I love coming up with new solutions and ideas for problems.
I am looking to make a real impact at any place I'm in.

During my Bachelor's degree,
I've developed a bot for the Technion students. 
You can see the code in repository **Tbot**.
You are also welcome to try and [use the bot](https://t.me/Technion_help_bot).
